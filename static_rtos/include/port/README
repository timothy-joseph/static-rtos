The porter should declare a mcu specific header file if needed into which to
declare the mcu_context_t struct. All of the function should be defined in a
c source file of the same name as the header file, with the .h replaced with
a .c put in the appropriate directory. The porter also needs to modify
port.h and come up with a unique define for his port

int port_getcontext(mcu_context_t *ucp);

This function is used to get the current context of the cpu and put it into
ucp.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure

---

int port_setcontext(const mcu_context_t *ucp);

This function is used to set the current context of the cpu to ucp.
Returns 0 on success (or doesn't return on success) and -1 on failure

---

void port_makecontext(mcu_context_t *ucp, void *stack, size_t stack_size,
		      mcu_context_t *successor_ctx, void (*func)(void *),
		      void *args);

This function is used to set the context of ucp to point to func with argument
args. The stack of this context will be stack with size stack_size.
successor_ctx is the return context. On linux, the args argument doesn't work

Before calling this function, call port_getcontext to get all other registers
initialized

---

int port_swapcontext(mcu_context_t *oucp, const mcu_context_t *cp);

This function saves the current context into oucp and loads the context from cp
Returns -1 on error and doesn't return on success

---

int port_enable_tick_interrupt(void)

This function enables global interrupts and then enables the timer interrupt
that will handle the tick interrupt

Returns 0 on success and 1 on error (such as such timers not being available
on the current platform)

---

The tick isr

Ports must define in their port source code a appropriate isr that must contain
the following steps (c pseudocode). This definition will be found in a header
file (src/kernel/port_timer.h; src/kernel/avr_port_timer.h) which is included into
the file scheduler.c at the end so that the isr will have access to the
global variables defined inside of scheduler.c

```c
void
tick_isr(void)
{
	reset_timer();
	
	if (kincrease_tickcount()) {
		yield_to_scheduler
	}
}
```

---

PORT_ENABLE_INTERRUPTS()

This function or macro enables global interrupts

---

PORT_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS()

This function or macro disables global interrupts

---

PORT_ARE_INTERRUPTS_ENABLED()

This function or macro returns 1 if interrupts are enabled and 0 otherwise

---

PORT_BEGIN_ATOMIC()

This function begins a atomic block of code. It must support at least 255
nested atomic blocks.

---

PORT_END_ATOMIC()

This function ends a atomic block of code. It must support at least 255
nested atomic blocks

---

PORT_IS_ATOMIC()

This function returns 1 if a atomic block is active
